# Overview

This short tutorial describes a way to make a virtual machine configured for ESP32 software development with Eclipse, and explains how to start using it. The virtualization environment is VirtualBox, and the guest machine runs Linux Mint.

Versions are:

* Linux Mint: 20.3
* Eclipse for C/C++ Developers: 2021â€‘12 R
* Eclipse IDF plugin: 2.4.1
* ESP-IDF: 4.4.1

# Prerequisites

* hardware: a 64-bit computer with enough memory so that the VM can be granted 8 GB, with a few tens of GB available on the disk, and one free USB A port
* hardware (bis): an [Espressif ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc) with an USB A / micro USB B cable - any similar development board can be used
* software development competencies: 
  * basic knowledge of Linux (knowing the most common commands...)
  * basic knowledge of VirtualBox (knowing how to create a virtual machine...)

# Creation of the VM

Check [this guide](https://github.com/PascalBod/lm-vm) to create a Linux Mint 20.3 VM.

# VM configuration

## Prerequisites

### Python

Latest Linux Mint versions (20.n) come with python3. Define the **python** command so that it runs python3 by installing the **python-is-python3** package:

```shell
$ sudo apt install python-is-python3
```

Additionally, install the **python3-virtualenv** package:

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
```

### Eclipse

Go to the [Eclipse Installer download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2021-12/r) and download the Linux x86_64 version. Important: be sure to download the 2021-12 version. Check the integrity of the downloaded file with `sha512sum`. Create the **~/DevTools** directory, and extract the contents of the downloaded file into it.

Run `~/DevTools/eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst`.

Choose **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers**. Keep the default path values. Click on the **Install** button, accept the license.

At the end of the installation, launch Eclipse, accept the proposed workspace, and keep Eclipse open for next steps. Eclipse version is 2021-12.

### Git

Install git:

```shell
$ sudo apt install git
```

### Ccache

Ccache improves build time. Install it:

```shell
$ sudo apt install ccache
```

## Eclipse IDF plugin

Going back to Eclipse, close the **Welcome** tab.

[Install the IDF plugin](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#installing-idf-plugin-using-update-site-url) (stable release). At the time of writing, this is version 2.5.0.

Restart Eclipse. If Eclipse displays almost nothing, excepted a few small icons, click on the **Restore** icon on the left-hand side of the window:

## ESP-IDF installation

[Install ESP-IDF from Eclipse](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#installing-esp-idf). Choose `v4.4.1` for the version, and select the `DevTools` directory as download directory.

## Tools installation

A message box offers to download the tools. Click on the **Yes** button. In the **Install Tools** dialog box that appears, click on **Install Tools** button.

# ESP32-DevKitC connection

Connect the DevKitC board to a USB port of the computer. Check that the virtual machine can see it, with **Devices > USB**. A new USB device should be visible: *Silicon Labs CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller*. Tick the associated checkbox.

You can assign the board to the virtual machine on a permanent basis with **Devices > USB > USB Settings...**.

# Sample application

[Create a new project](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#create-a-new-project-using-esp-idf-templates), choosing the *hello_world* template.

[Configure a launch target](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#configuring-launch-target) for the board. Build the project, as explained [here](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#compiling-the-project).

Flash the project, as explained [here](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#flashing-the-project). If the console shows that the flashing operation does not start right after having requested it, i.e. the console waits on `Connecting........_____...`, hold down the board BOOT button until the flashing operation starts (a little bit more than 1 s). 

To display trace messages printed by the application, [start a terminal](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#viewing-serial-output).

# Upgrade

To upgrade ESP-IDF, select **Espressif > Download and Configure ESP-IDF** and select the ESP-IDF version to download. Once downloaded, the ESP-IDF plugin might ask you to install a new set of tools. Accept, and install the tools. 

To upgrade the Eclipse IDF plugin, check [this section](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#how-do-i-upgrade-my-existing-idf-eclipse-plugin).
